Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation
Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of the classic game theory problem known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. 
The simulation models the interactions between two prisoners who must decide whether to cooperate with or betray each other without knowing the other's decision. 
The outcomes are determined by their combined choices, demonstrating the concepts of trust, betrayal, and payoff in competitive environments.
